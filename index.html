           <p>
            It is normal to make mistakes when learning something new. People learn new things through mistakes. We have different means to help when we are stuck with something. Where everyone can get help.If anyone is stuck here or having an error, try 1-2 hours on your own, find a solution on Google, scroll through our group's posts but you can't solve it in any way. So there is an expectation to move forward to the next goal by solving your own problem from any problem support session.
